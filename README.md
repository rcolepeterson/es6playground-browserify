#ES6 - Playground - with Browserify.

###A dev environment for playing around with [ES6](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html).

Your ES6 code will be transpiled to ES5 using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and served up in a browser using [Browsersync](http://www.browsersync.io/).

**Enabling modules with [Browserify](http://browserify.org/).**


With modules, JavaScript will finally be getting a sane and modern module system backed into the language. This plays the role that tools like RequireJS have done in the past, namely letting you import and export values between files.

We're using Browserify to package everything up. How Browserify works, is it follows all the imported dependencies and then packages it up into one JS file.


## Install

$ npm install

## Run

$ gulp


You can now play around with all the cool new features that ES6 has to offer.
